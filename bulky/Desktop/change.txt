Thank you for quick fix, however there are many things still missing.

Many buttons still are yellow around the website, can you please go through pages and see what is still yellow? 
for example, Contact, Blog, Cart box are all still yellow, even Deal of the Day side buttons are yellow.
====> changed color in admin


Search bar still not aligned correctly, please check screenshots attached.
====> changed in file /home/bulky/public_html/app/design/frontend/Alothemes/expert2/web/css/style.css

Capture1: Can you change the words to lowercase in BULKY.AE to Bulky.ae?
====> changed in file /home/bulky/public_html/app/design/frontend/Alothemes/expert1/Magento_Newsletter/templates/subscribe-popup.phtml.


Capture4: these are not sellers link they are brands, can we make them sellers that are featured?
