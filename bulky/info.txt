I'm sorry I think it still looks misaligned, the logo is lower than search bar, or search bar too much up.

====> changed in file /home/bulky/public_html/app/design/frontend/Alothemes/expert2/web/css/style.css

- All buttons in yellow around the website to be changed to the grey color code in the attached windows button.
- attached image (capture3): the "go top" button should also be grey.
- attached image (capture4): when you change it to grey please watch out for the edges and borders of each button as I still see yellow frame, so it can be darker grey maybe a little to show button is highlighted.

====> changed color in admin

- Can you please fix the cart issue so when adding to it does not squish menu like mentioned above and you can remove the AED total amount, I think bubble number is enough to indicate total order count.

====> change file /home/bulky/public_html/app/design/frontend/Alothemes/expert2/Magento_Checkout/templates/cart/minicart.phtml

- attached image (capture7): can you rename button please to "Negotiate Price" and make it aligned the text because it seems lowered.
====> not find

About text, you can change it in file:
/home/bulky/public_html/app/design/frontend/Alothemes/expert1/Magento_Newsletter/templates/subscribe-popup.phtml
--> For text, please see attached (Capture1), I put numbers on picture and will reference below:
- circle 1: please replace "Welcome to Expert" with "Welcome to Bulky.ae" and you can use my logo on main page instead of the word 'Bulky.ae'.
- circle 2: please remove discount sentence.
- circle 3: use text "to receive more about latest bulk items for sale, please enter your email below to join the newsletter".
- circle 4: please remove text.
- keep option for "Don't show this popup again".
