<p><strong>Local Dock/Commercial Dock</strong>- This shipping is for you to pick up at your local freight terminal, If you live in a rural area your terminal will likely be located in the closest or second closest MAJOR city. Contact us if you want us to locate the local terminal city.<strong>Commercial Dock</strong>delivery is delivery to a business that has a loading dock or forklift with the ability to off load the game without the use of a lift gate.</p>

<p><strong>As with all freight deliveries shipments must be carefully inspected before signed for, PLEASE MAKE SURE WHO EVER SIGNS FOR IT INSPECTS THE GAME AS BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Closely examine the box and packing materials to make sure there is no damage BEFORE you sign the Bill Of Lading accepting it. If there is ANY damage, We recommend you unbox and</strong><strong>inspect</strong><strong>the machine before you sign, freight companies are an absolute nightmare if you sign and there is damage and it hasn't been noted on the Bill Of Lading. If you find any damage to the machine CALL US BEFORE you sign and we will help you decide how to proceed.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Once you sign for a game as being in good condition you own the game, if there is any damages we will do our best to help you file a freight claim. But due to the nature of hidden damage claims Game Exchange of Colorado cannot be held responsible for any damages not noted on the Bill of Lading.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For our customers who wish to pick their game up at a local Terminal, if you sign for it undamaged and there is any damage to the machine what so ever there is NOTHING we can do as the freight company will blame the damage on your secondary transport. So if you</strong><strong>pick</strong><strong>it</strong><strong>up</strong><strong>I HIGHLY recommend you unbox if BEFORE you sign for it!!!!</strong></p>
