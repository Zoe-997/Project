I tested few email today morning for email templates and please find below feedback. 
I am give some of the examples to give you idea on what's needed but apply that across email wherever applicable.

1. Font's needs to be streamlined. If you inspect whole email, you would notice there are two fonts used. 
Tahoma and Arial. It should use single font across email to be uniform across the email, including footer.
Example: Footer, order information are in Arial and rest is in Tahoma.

2. Font size for text is different so
Title "Invoice Information" is 13px 
whereas "Billing Info, Shipping Info, Payment Method, Shipping Method" is 12px.
Informational text like Order No is 12px but order information is 14px

3. Font color seems to be different as well. Not sure if font size and font type is causing that but please check.

4. Two separator after Need Help which should be just one separator.

5. I think you update New Order template with Invoice information but that would be easy fix once formatting is finalized.

6. I think you made changes just for Order template as Footer doesn't show up correctly on other emails like . Invoice, Credit Memo, Welcome, New Subscription, etc

Besides, let me know if rest of email templates will have same formatting with fonts, font size and color ? 
I assume you would make final changes to email css which apply to all emails to keep same formatting.
