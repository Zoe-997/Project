Home Page Your Account : Rename to "Login" to "Signin" then "My Account" to "Register" = maybe one could be removed or active depending on login or logout.

rename Login to Signin on bottom page = maybe one could be removed or active depending on login or logout.

(Account Menu pulldown) "Signin" must be renamed to "Login"

Where is the new Public "Affliate Program" pages? We must place this topic public at home page bottom "Affliate Program"

Also where is Affliate "Signin" and "Login"?

FYI there is a shopping cart bug that when I add items to cart it stays one the same screen. Now I can't duplicate it. Please note, you must test to add all items to shopping carts as shipping cart add changes on my browser a few times. The process should remain the same.

Products item size select display are not always sorted on page. i.e. A B C D E F G
